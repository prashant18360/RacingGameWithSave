# Racing Game With Save :- Commandline Jave Project
The game starts with the user entering the total number of tiles on the race track. Each tile represents one position in one dimension. A tile can be of type Snake, Vulture, Cricket, White, or Trampoline . This is a single player game and once the game starts, its the computer who plays the game without any user intervention, and continues playing until the player wins. For this must use I/O Streams, Serialization, Deserialization, and JUnit Testing. This project is the extended version of my previous project called RacingGame repository. It has included Save option in the existing Game.
The detail about the Input/Output & description, read the another repository(called RacingGame)'s pdf.
The detail about the Input/Output of extended terms introduced in the current project, read the current repository pdf. 
Here, TileGameVersion_2.java is the main code.
